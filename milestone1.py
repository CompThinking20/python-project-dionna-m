#I will be creating a function for my project, which is to make a 2020 random playlist generator. The function I will be using is "genre," which will define the types of songs for my generator. I intend for the genre function to be defined by music attributes, such as Pop, Rock, Hip Hop, R&B, ect. Its argument would be "songs" since I will have specific lists of songs that categorize each genre. Likely, the return value would be "songs".

#Below is a list containing songs that categorize the pop genre for my generator. There is only one list right now, but more will be filled out in my Milestone2.py file.
