Project Overview:

I proposed for my project to create a random 2020 playlist generator. What I had intended was for the generator to take a certain genre and suggest at least ten songs that would fit its style. Originally, the range of songs would have been much bigger with it including both new and old songs, but I decided to narrow it down to music released this year only. I was inspired by music platforms like Spotify and YouTube Music, but I desired for my playlists to be less invasive and simple. Instead, I wanted my program to be more like a recommendation of music they would like to listen but not songs that they would already like based on their listening history those platforms track. With my project, I was able to accomplish the generator asking the user to pick a genre. I had created seven different lists for the seven genres I included in my project. Due to an error about an undefined name in my code (which I wasn't able to successfully fix), I was unable to get my generator to return songs froms my lists to the user. Despite this, I am satisfied that my "if else" statements partially work and that I was able to create a program from scratch despite having no prior experience with coding before taking this course. 

Project Narrative:

For me, the process in creating my generator was quite difficult and confusing since I did not originally know where to start. I was unsure about whether I should create a function or a class that would best suit what I wanted for my generator. I found your lecture on Text Generators to be helpful though and I opted to go with creating a function. For my first milestone, I created a list for my "pop" genre and filled it out with songs I had gathered that matched the genre of pop. This took a while to fill out since I did it manually and didn't use a database, which I wasn't sure how to do. I was able to create my function by taking the example you provided in the Text Generators lecture and editing it to suit what I wanted for my generator. For my second milestone, I built from there by creating additional lists for "k-pop", "r&b", "and "hip-hop". At first, I thought that I had to repeat the function for every list I made since there were a different number of songs in each. After getting back your comments and scheduling a meeting with you, I found that the "len" function was a simpler solution that required less typing. Also, you informed me about needing user input. By creating "if else" statements, it would allow my users to actually pick one of my listed genres and hopefully receive an output of songs for that genre. I had to rewatch your Types and Operators lecture to refresh my mind on how to create "if else" statements. I also watched a couple YouTube videos to make sure what I was doing was right. Something I would definitely do differently if I had another chance would be to pull songs for my lists from an established database because my method involved a lot of typing and it was very time-consuming. Unfortunately, I wasn't sure where I could access one or even how to do it, so I would also ask for guidance on what I should do for that. I originally planned to have at least ten different genres, but I ended up going with seven because I was tiring myself out and creating unnecessary work for myself.

Corrections:

I thought your comments on my second milestone were helpful, especially when you mentioned that I needed user input. Honestly, I work better seeing things in real time because I'm a visual learner, so meeting with you during your office hours really helped. You pointed out speficic mistakes I made in my code and answered my questions in Atom. After speaking with you, I was able to see that I had stray marks in front of my list names that were causing errors in my code, such as "&" when I had named my list "r&b" in line 9 and a "-" for my "hip-hop" list in line 11. I ended up fixing these by renaming them "rhythm_and_blues" and "hip_hop", which I think worked. Also, after studying up again on "if else" statements, I was able to create seven if statements that would print out songs from the genre the user chooses after reading my question in line 28. I also created an else statement for when they entered a different answer from the options I provided. Honestly, I was able to get the terminal to ask my user for input, but due to an error in lines 20 through 22 with my "random.randint" function, my program does not provide an output of my songs. An error message keeps popping up about "random" in lines 20 and 22 being undefined. I'm not sure how I could have defined it even after researching how and trying to correct it. In the Text Generator lecture, I didn't see you define "random", so I don't know why the terminal in repl.it kept bringing up that error.

Overall, while my project does not run as I had planned, I was able to learn how to create and define a function as well as use if else statements for user input. While I'm definitely not anywhere close to being an expert, I feel like I have a basic understanding about computing and know more than I did when I started the class.
